# Plugin.Firebase

This is a wrapper library around the native Android and iOS Firebase Xamarin SDKs. It includes cross-platform APIs for Firebase [Analytics](https://firebase.google.com/docs/analytics), [Auth](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth), [Cloud Messaging](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cloud-messaging), [Dynamic Links](https://firebase.google.com/docs/dynamic-links), [Firestore](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore), [Cloud Functions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/functions), [Remote Config](https://firebase.google.com/docs/remote-config) and [Storage](https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage).

## Installation
### Nuget
[![NuGet](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/plugin.firebase.svg?maxAge=86400&style=flat)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Plugin.Firebase/)

> Install-Package Plugin.Firebase

#### Visual Studio 2022 on Windows:
If you encounter a build error, try to add the package via `dotnet add package Plugin.Firebase`, see [issue #69](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/issues/65) for more information.

## Basic setup

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/), if you don't already have one. If you already have an existing Google project associated with your mobile app, click **Import Google Project**. Otherwise, click **Create New Project**.
2. Click **Add Firebase to your *[iOS|Android]* app** and follow the setup steps. If you're importing an existing Google project, this may happen automatically and you can just download the config file.
3. Add ```[GoogleService-Info.plist|google-services.json]``` file to your app project.
4. Set ```[GoogleService-Info.plist|google-services.json]``` **build action** behaviour to ```[Bundle Resource|GoogleServicesJson]``` by Right clicking/Build Action.
5. Add the following line of code to the place where your app gets bootstrapped:
```c#
CrossFirebase.Initialize(..., new CrossFirebaseSettings(...));
```

## .NET MAUI support
The new plugin version 1.2.0 now supports .NET MAUI applications with .NET 6 ðŸš€ 

To get started add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` and the `google-services.json` files to the root folder of your project and include them in the .csproj file like this:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0-android'">
    <GoogleServicesJson Include="google-services.json" />
</ItemGroup>

<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0-ios'">
    <BundleResource Include="GoogleService-Info.plist" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Put the initialization call from step 5 of the basic setup in your `MauiProgram.cs` like this:

```c#
public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        return MauiApp
            .CreateBuilder()
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            ...
            .RegisterFirebaseServices()
            .Build();
    }
    
    private static MauiAppBuilder RegisterFirebaseServices(this MauiAppBuilder builder)
    {
        builder.ConfigureLifecycleEvents(events => {
#if IOS
            events.AddiOS(iOS => iOS.FinishedLaunching((app, launchOptions) => {
                CrossFirebase.Initialize(app, launchOptions, CreateCrossFirebaseSettings());
                return false;
            }));
#else
            events.AddAndroid(android => android.OnCreate((activity, state) =>
                CrossFirebase.Initialize(activity, state, CreateCrossFirebaseSettings())));
#endif
        });
        
        builder.Services.AddSingleton(_ => CrossFirebaseAuth.Current);
        return builder;
    }
    
    private static CrossFirebaseSettings CreateCrossFirebaseSettings()
    {
        return new CrossFirebaseSettings(isAuthEnabled: true);
    }
}
```
Ensure the `ApplicationId` in your `.csproj` file matches the `bundle_id` and `package_name` inside of the `[GoogleService-Info.plist|google-services.json]` files:
```xml
<ApplicationId>com.example.myapp</ApplicationId>
```

The plugin doesn't support Windows or Mac catalyst, so either remove their targets from your `.csproj` file or use  [preprocessor directives](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/preprocessor-directives#conditional-compilation) and [MSBuild conditions](https://learn.microsoft.com/de-de/visualstudio/msbuild/msbuild-conditions?view=vs-2022), e.g:

```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0-ios' OR '$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0-android'">
    <PackageReference Include="Plugin.Firebase" Version="1.2.0" />
</ItemGroup>
```

### Android specifics
- Add the following `ItemGroup` to your `.csproj file` to prevent build errors:
```xml
<ItemGroup Condition="'$(TargetFramework)' == 'net6.0-android'">
  <PackageReference Include="Xamarin.Kotlin.StdLib.Jdk7" Version="1.7.10" ExcludeAssets="build;buildTransitive" />
  <PackageReference Include="Xamarin.Kotlin.StdLib.Jdk8" Version="1.7.10" ExcludeAssets="build;buildTransitive" />
</ItemGroup>
```

Take a look at the [sample project](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/tree/development/sample/Playground) to get more information.

## Plugin.Firebase.Legacy
If you are working with an older Xamarin project and are not able to migrate to .NET MAUI yet, there is a legacy version of the plugin called [Plugin.Firebase.Legacy](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Plugin.Firebase.Legacy/). The code for this package is located on a branch called `legacy`. Bugfixes or other small important changes can be done here and will be synced to the `development/master` branch if needed.

### Android specifics
- Add the following `PackageReference` to the `.csproj file` of your android project to prevent a build error (see this [github comment](https://github.com/xamarin/GooglePlayServicesComponents/issues/379#issuecomment-733266753) for more information):
```xml
<PackageReference Include="Xamarin.Google.Guava.ListenableFuture" Version="1.0.0.2" ExcludeAssets="build;buildTransitive" />
```
- If you receive an error that states the `default Firebase App is not initialized`, adding one package explicitly seems to resolve this issue (it doesn't seem to matter which package gets added).

## Documentation and samples

In the [docs folder](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/blob/development/docs) you can find for every feature a designated readme file that describes the setup and usage of this feature or where to find more information.

In the [sample folder](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/blob/development/sample) you can find a sample Xamarin.Forms project. This project serves as a base to play around with the plugin and to test features that are hard to test automatically (like Authentication or Cloud Messages). [playground-functions](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/blob/development/sample/playground-functions) is a Cloud Functions project and contains the code to enable sending Cloud Messages from the backend.

In the [tests folder](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/blob/development/tests) you can find a Xamarin.Forms project that lets you run integration tests. You should definitely check out the ```*Fixture.cs``` files to learn how the plugin is supposed to work. All the tests should pass when they get executed on a real device.

In case you would like to run the sample or test project by yourself, you need to add the ```GoogleService-Info.plist``` and ```google-services.json``` files of your own firebase project and adapt the other config files like ```Info.plist, Entitlements.plist, AndroidManifest.xml```.

## Using Firebase Local Emulator Suite
If you would like to use the [Firebase Local Emulator Suite](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite) for your tests or rapid prototyping you can do so by following the steps of the [Getting started guide](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_and_prototype) and calling the [`UseEmulator(host, port)`](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/blob/development/src/Shared/Firestore/IFirebaseFirestore.cs#L45) method of the desired firebase service before doing any other operations.

For example the [`Plugin.Firebase.IntegrationTests`](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/tree/development/tests/Plugin.Firebase.IntegrationTests) project is configured to be able to use the [Cloud Firestore emulator](https://firebase.google.com/docs/emulator-suite/connect_firestore). You can start the emulator with initial seed data by running `firebase emulators:start --only firestore --import=test-data/`. Uncomment the line `CrossFirebaseFirestore.Current.UseEmulator("localhost", 8080);` in [`IntegrationTestAppDelegate.cs`](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/blob/development/tests/Plugin.Firebase.TestHarness.iOS/IntegrationTestAppDelegate.cs) or [`MainActivity.cs`](https://github.com/TobiasBuchholz/Plugin.Firebase/blob/development/tests/Plugin.Firebase.TestHarness.Android/MainActivity.cs) to let the test project know it should use the emulator. Now all firestore related tests should pass.
